-- ORDER OF EXECUTION FOR QUERIES -- 
--(1) FROM and JOIN determines the tables you will work with 
--(2) WHERE filters out certain rows from the tables to determine what data you will work with
--(3) GROUP BY will give you the information for each unique value of a certain column (for that aggregate function)
--(4) HAVING filters out certain grouped rows based on a constraint
--(5) SELECT will actually compute the columns desired 
--(6) DISTINCT will remove any duplicates in the selected data
--(7) ORDER BY will sort the selected data 
--(8) LIMIT and OFFSET will give a certain subset of the rows if desired
       (OFFSET will determine which row to start from when limiting to a certain number of rows)
